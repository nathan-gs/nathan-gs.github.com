                    <div>I am very interested in and work with <h4>Big Data</h4>, from the processing and storage of large
                        volumes, to
                        real-time stream
                        processing, and machine learning. I read,
                        tweet, and
                        try out as much as I can about new Big Data technologies,
                        like Spark, Samza, Storm and Kafka,
                        as well as more established technologies like Hadoop and Cassandra and learning as
                        much as I can in the process. 
                        I use Scala, Java and bits of Python and Hadoop Pig Latin. I setup, administered and monitored Hadoop,
                        Mesos, Storm, Cassandra &amp; Zookeeper clusters.

                    <div>Next to programming I have always been passionate about <h4>Linux</h4> and open source. I have
                        used over the last 10+ years several distributions from Debian
                        &amp; Ubuntu,
                        CentOS over Gentoo to Linux From Scratch, lately I am very interested in NixOS. NixOS is a purely functional Linux. I have setup countless
                        servers from Cloud to virtualized to bare metal servers.

                        I am following the DevOps movement. I am using Puppet, Chef and NixOps to automate and Ganglia to monitor critical infrastructure. I have open sourced
                        and contributed to several NixOS and Puppet modules.
