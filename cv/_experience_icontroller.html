From October 2009 to August 2010 I started working at <h4>iController</h4>, a small SME in Ghent, as <h4>web
        application developer</h4>. I developed a new, greatly improved debtor &amp; credit management web application. We
        used the symfony framework as a starting point to create a stable and easy to
        maintain
        application.
