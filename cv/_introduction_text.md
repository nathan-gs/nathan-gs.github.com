I am Nathan Bijnens, a software developer turned __Solution Architect__ with a passion for Business, Cloud, 
the Internet of Things, Big Data and Artificial Intelligence. As a _Cloud Solution Architect, Advanced Analytics + AI_ 
I drive high priority customer initiatives, leveraging Microsoft AI on Azure to solve the biggest and most complex data and IoT challenges faced by Microsoft's enterprise customers. 

Working in a entrepreneurial, data driven, innovative environment gives me energy.  

As a solution architect I help my customers on their Digital Transformation journey. I guide my clients to 
Artificial Intelligence, to become Data Driven and with all their data in the Cloud needs. 
I not only help on envisioning what data can do for business, I analyse, give recommendations, 
design architectures and help with data implementations. 

My focus is on data analytics and building Big Data applications. I am especially interested in real-time Big Data, actively developing applications on top of Spark Streaming, designing Lambda and Kappa-like architectures. I advise on Big Data Strategies and evangelize Cloud, Big Data and IoT to clients and at conferences.
