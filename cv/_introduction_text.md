I am Nathan Bijnens, a software developer turned __Solution Architect__ with a passion for Business, Cloud, 
the Internet of Things, Big Data and Artificial Intelligence. As the __Lead Cloud Solution Architect__ for the __European Union Institutions__ and __NATO__ at __Microsoft__ I help the European Union and NATO become a _Data Driven Government_. I drive customers initiatives, leveraging Microsoft AI on Azure to solve the biggest and most complex data and IoT challenges faced by Microsoft's strategic public sector. 

As a solution architect I help my customers on their Digital Transformation journey. I guide my clients to 
Artificial Intelligence, share data more efficiently, and to become Data Driven.
With a successful track record of building innovative systems in highly political and complex environments, 
I not only help on envisioning what data can do for business, I analyze, give recommendations, design architectures and help with data implementations. 

My focus is on data analytics and building Big Data systems, especially real-time Big Data and messaging-based systems. I am actively developing applications on top of Spark Streaming, designing Lambda and Kappa-like architectures. I am experienced with Java, Scala, Functional Programming, Linux, DevOps, Containers and of course Cloud. 

As part of my role as Lead Solution Architect, I coach and mentor my colleagues and set-out the strategy and go-to-market towards our strategic public sector customers. 

I enjoy working with clients and partners, from giving advice, talking about the Business and Technological value of Big Data and Internet of Things, to Requirement Analysis. Working in an entrepreneurial, data driven, innovative environment gives me energy.  

I am a passionate speaker and evangelist, on AI, Big Data, IoT and Cloud.
