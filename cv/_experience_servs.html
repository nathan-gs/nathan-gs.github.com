                    From April till August 2011 I worked as a consultant for <h4>Truvo</h4>, the Belgian yellow pages,
                    doing a <h4>
                        hadoop deduplication</h4> job. I used Hadoop &amp; Hadoop Pig, wrote custom UDFs in
                    Java for Ngram matching and solved
                    performance
                    issues. At first Amazon Elastic
                    MapReduce was used, later I setup a Hadoop cluster.

                In 2009 I was active as a consultant to a Dutch services organization. The assignment mainly consisted
                of <h4>creating a link between existing systems and a new website</h4>.

                From 2008 till present I perform various <h4>short term consultancy</h4> tasks commissioned by <h4>
                    Sinergio</h4>
                . For a <h5>semi government organization</h5> I set up a new tomcat server and
                did a general check up
                on their Linux servers. For another company I configured an ASP.Net application and installed
                an IIS server. For <h5>Sio Hosting</h5> (Formerly Sinergio Hosting) I planned and
                executed the move
                from traditional servers to a virtualized xen cluster.
                I also checked the integrity and security
                of their hosting platform on a regular basis. I advised them on
                strategic planning.
