<div>Next to programming I have always been passionate about <h4>Linux</h4> and open source. I have
    used over the last 20+ years several distributions from Debian
    &amp; Ubuntu,
    CentOS over Gentoo to Linux From Scratch, lately I am very interested in NixOS. NixOS is a purely functional Linux.
    I have setup countless
    servers from Cloud to virtualized to bare metal servers.

    I am following the DevOps movement. I am using Puppet, Chef and NixOps to automate and Ganglia to monitor critical
    infrastructure. I have open sourced
    and contributed to several NixOS and Puppet modules.

    I follow and try out with great interest Cloud related techniques
    and technologies, in all its forms: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, â€¦
    I have used as test or in production Azure,
    OpenStack, Amazon AWS, Google
    BigQuery (private beta tester) and Softlayer.
