<div>I am very interested in and work with <h4>Big Data</h4>, from the processing and storage of large
    volumes, to
    real-time stream
    processing, and machine learning. I read,
    tweet, and
    try out as much as I can about new Big Data technologies,
    like Spark, Samza, Storm and Kafka,
    as well as more established technologies like Hadoop and Cassandra and learning as
    much as I can in the process.
    I use Scala, Java and bits of Python and Hadoop Pig Latin. I setup, administered and monitored Hadoop,
    Mesos, Storm, Cassandra &amp; Zookeeper clusters.
