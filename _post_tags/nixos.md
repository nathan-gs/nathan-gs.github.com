NixOS is a [Linux]({% include tag_url tag="Linux" %}) distribution that uses Nix as its package manager and build system. Nix is a purely functional package manager that treats packages as values in a functional language, and stores them in a unique and immutable way in the Nix store. This allows for multiple versions, complete dependencies, atomic upgrades, rollbacks, and multi-user support. Nixpkgs is the package repository that contains thousands of packages for Nix and NixOS. Users can install packages using the nix-env command, and configure their system using the nixos-rebuild command. Nix also supports declarative configuration. Nix is designed to make software management easy and predictable.
