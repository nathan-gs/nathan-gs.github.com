title: Agentic AI
---

Agentic AI refers to AI systems that can autonomously perceive, reason, plan, and take actions to achieve specific goals. Unlike traditional chatbots or simple automation, agentic AI systems can orchestrate complex workflows, use tools, and collaborate with humans or other agents to complete multi-step tasks.

Key characteristics of agentic AI include:
- **Autonomous decision-making**: Agents can independently determine the next steps to accomplish a goal
- **Tool use**: Agents can invoke APIs, databases, and external systems
- **Multi-agent collaboration**: Multiple specialized agents can work together on complex problems
- **Human-in-the-loop**: Effective agentic systems maintain human oversight and control

At [Scrydon](https://scrydon.com/platform/agentic-ai), we're building a flow-based agentic AI platform that enables organizations to deploy intelligent agents while retaining full control and sovereignty over their data and processes.
