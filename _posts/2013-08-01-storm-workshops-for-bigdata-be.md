A bit later than first planned, but we'll be having the third workshop on real-time analytics with Storm next week Thursday 01/08/2013 in Antwerp

The goals will be many-fold:

1) getting to run Storm in distributed mode with Vagrant across all of our machines

2) implementing the Yahoo Finance Spout

3) implementing Bolts for the business logic defined in the previous workshop

4) bootstrap a simple web-application to display the Storm output: the ranked stocks

Lot's of stuff to do so it would be great to see similar enthousiasm like the previous workshop, but if you're mostly in for learning: you're more than welcome as well!
