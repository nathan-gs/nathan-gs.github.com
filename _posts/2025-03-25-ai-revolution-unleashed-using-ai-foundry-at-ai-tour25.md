At the Microsoft AI Tour Brussels of March 2025, **[Nico Grassetto](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicograssetto/)** and I presented the _AI Revolution unleashed using AI Foundry_, highlighting the transformative power of AI in modern applications. It emphasizes the importance of a unified app platform for the AI era, focusing on the integration of various AI models and automated workflows. The core of this revolution is the Azure AI Foundry, a comprehensive platform designed to develop and deploy custom copilots. It offers a complete AI toolchain, responsible AI tools, and enterprise-grade production capabilities. The Foundry includes a model catalog with open-source, foundational, task, and industry models, along with advanced customization services and enterprise-grade observability.

The future envisioned by the Foundry is one where every application is powered by AI agents, making it a one-stop shop for building and managing AI applications efficiently and securely. It included demos of the latest [Autogen Studio](/2024/06/23/autogen-multi-agent-llms-to-solve-complex-tasks/), [AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com) and the [Github Models marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/models-github).
