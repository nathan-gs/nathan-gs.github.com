During Microsoft Belgium & Luxembourg's Customer Success Day we presented a session on **Data Mesh**.

Data Mesh is a new decentralized socio-technical approach to managing data, designed to work with organizational complexity and continuous growth. It enables large organizations to get value from their data, at scale, through reusability, analytics and ML. It is building on the **Domain Driven Design (DDD)** methodology

Data mesh is a design pattern that emphasizes the importance of data governance and data ownership in an organization. It is based on the idea that data should be treated as a first-class citizen in the same way that traditional software applications are. This approach borrows a lot from Domain Driven Design (DDD), a software development methodology that focuses on creating a shared understanding of the business domain and using that understanding to inform the design of software systems.

One way that data mesh can be linked to DDD is by using the concepts of bounded contexts and strategic design. In DDD, a bounded context is a boundary within which a specific domain model applies. This helps to create a clear separation of concerns within the system and ensures that different parts of the system are not unnecessarily coupled.

Data Mesh takes this concept a step further by establishing data ownership within each bounded context. This means that a particular team or group is responsible for the data within their bounded context, and they are empowered to make decisions about how that data is used and shared. This helps to align data governance with the business domain and ensures that data is treated as a strategic asset rather than an afterthought. The idea of Data Mesh was introduced by Zhamak Deghani in a very interesting blog post: [How to Move Beyond a Monolithic Data Lake to a Distributed Data Mesh](https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-monolith-to-mesh.html).

Data Mesh introduces the concept of Data Products, where data is no longer a side-effect and using a product management approach. By making data products available to other teams and groups, teams are able to share insights and knowledge, and build on the work of others to create new and innovative solutions. This helps to create a culture of continuous learning and improvement within the organization.
