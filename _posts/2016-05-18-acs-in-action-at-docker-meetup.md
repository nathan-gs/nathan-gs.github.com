categories: [presentations]

More than 50 Docker and DevOps enthusiasts attended 
the [Impromptu: Container Ops, from Pets to Cattle with DC/OS (w/ AZUG)](https://www.meetup.com/Docker-Belgium/events/230661369/) hosted at
Microsoft. 

I gave a presentation how easy it is to get started with Mesosphere DC/OS on [Azure Container Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-service/) and 
a small demo of Mesosphere DC/OS on Azure, and how it integrates with other services like [Event Hubs](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/event-hubs/) and [Power BI](https://powerbi.com).
