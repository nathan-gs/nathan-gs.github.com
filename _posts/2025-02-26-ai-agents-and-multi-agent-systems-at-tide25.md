In today's fast-evolving landscape, AI agents are redefining how organizations operate, leveraging cutting-edge artificial intelligence and large language models (LLMs) to automate processes, boost productivity, and unlock scalability. In my upcoming presentation, Introduction to AI Agents and Multi-Agent systems, I go into the dynamic roles these agents play—working autonomously or collaboratively with teams to streamline workflows, deliver personalized solutions, and optimize enterprise operations. From enhancing individual capabilities to driving organizational impact, AI agents are empowering innovation like never before. Attendees will explore real-world examples and practical applications that showcase their transformative potential.

I will also spotlight Autogen, a groundbreaking generalist multi-agent system developed by Microsoft Research. Join us to learn how AI agents and multi-agent systems can revolutionize your work, fostering efficiency, creativity, and growth.
