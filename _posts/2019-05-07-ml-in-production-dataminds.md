**[@WesleyBackelant](https://twitter.com/WesleyBackelant)** and I spoke at [dataminds.be](https://dataminds.be/events/data-science-in-production) meetup on **Machine Learning in Production** using the **[Microsoft AI](https://microsoft.com/ai)** platform. 
Our talk was mostly focussed on the [Team Data Science Process](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/team-data-science-process/overview), enabled by [Azure Machine Learning services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning-service/) and [Azure Databricks](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/databricks/) with [mlflow](https://mlflow.org).
